Morse code is a type of code that is used to send telegraphic 
information using rhythm. Morse code uses dots and dashes to 
show the alphabet letters, numbers, punctuation and special 
characters of a given message. When messages are sent by Morse 
code, dots are short beeps or clicks or flashes, and dashes are
longer ones.

Morse code was invented by an American called Samuel Finley Breese Morse, 
(1791-1872). He was not only an inventor but also a famous painter.
The first commercial telegraph was developed by William Forthergill 
Cooke and Charles Wheatstone in 1837. Then, in 1838, Samuel Morse and 
his assistant, Alfred Vail, demonstrated an even more successful telegraph
device which sent messages using a special code - Morse code.

The most well-known signal sent using Morse Code is:
"...   ---   ..."
and is the distress signal SOS.
